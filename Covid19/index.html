<p>Covid 19 also know as Coronaviruses is a type of virus which started at the begining of 2020 and this virus caused many problems. There are many different kinds, and some cause disease. A coronavirus identified in 2019, SARS-CoV-2, has caused a pandemic of respiratory illness, called COVID-19.

COVID-19 is the disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that emerged in December 2019.
COVID-19 can be severe, and has caused millions of deaths around the world as well as lasting health problems in some who have survived the illness.
The coronavirus can be spread from person to person. It is diagnosed with a test.
The best way to protect yourself is to get vaccinated and boosted when you are eligible, follow testing guidelines, wear a mask, wash your hands and practice physical distancing.
As of now, researchers know that the coronavirus is spread through droplets and virus particles released into the air when an infected person breathes, talks, laughs, sings, coughs or sneezes. Larger droplets may fall to the ground in a few seconds, but tiny infectious particles can linger in the air and accumulate in indoor places, especially where many people are gathered and there is poor ventilation. This is why mask-wearing, hand hygiene and physical distancing are essential to preventing COVID-19.
